A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Example</title> </head> <body> <?php echo \"Hi, I'm a PHP script!\" ; ?> </body> </html> PHP is lossly typed (i.e. types are not necessarily enforced), dynamically, implicitly typed (i.e. you don\u2019t have to declare variables), case sensitive (i.e. var and VAR are two different variables) and object-oriented (i.e. everything is an object, like C# and Java). PHP is a language like C that uses curly braces to contain code statements within loops or conditionals. PHP statements end with a semicolon (;) just like C. PHP Resources The website http://www.php.net is the official website for the PHP language, and Docs PHP Syntax A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document. A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?> The default file extension for PHP files is \".php\". A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code. PHP Case Sensitivity In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive. Warning: However; all variable names are case-sensitive! PHP Comments A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code. Syntax for single-line comments: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php // This is a single-line comment # This is also a single-line comment ?> </body> </html> Syntax for multiple-line comments: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php /* This is a multiple-lines comment block that spans over multiple lines */ ?> </body> </html>","title":"General"},{"location":"phpRefresh/#php-resources","text":"The website http://www.php.net is the official website for the PHP language, and Docs","title":"PHP Resources"},{"location":"phpRefresh/#php-syntax","text":"A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

As a simple case, we can assign a variable a value using the assignment operator, which is the \"equals\" sign. Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable: Remember that variables are case-sensitive! <?php $txt = \"Hello world!\" ; //No difference between \"\" and '' $x = 5 ; $y = 10.5 ; ?> After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, the variable $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5. Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value. Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Rules for PHP variables: A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character A variable name cannot start with a number A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables) Output Variables The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen. The following example will show how to output text and a variable: <?php $txt = \"phpTutorial\" ; echo \"I love $txt !\" ; ?> Tools for understanding strange objects var_dump() function var_dump() displays structured information about one or more expressions that includes its type and value.

A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes. $x = \"Hello world!\"; PHP Integer An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. Integers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2) notation <?php $a = 1234 ; // decimal number $a = 0123 ; // octal number (equivalent to 83 decimal) $a = 0 o123 ; // octal number (as of PHP 8.1.0) $a = 0x1A ; // hexadecimal number (equivalent to 26 decimal) $a = 0 b11111111 ; // binary number (equivalent to 255 decimal) $a = 1 _234_567 ; // decimal number (as of PHP 7.4.0) ?> PHP Float A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form. $x = 10.365; PHP Boolean A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE. $x = true; $y = false; PHP Array An array stores multiple values in one single variable. $x = array(\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Toyota\"); PHP Object Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming. A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties. Let's assume we have a class named Car. A Car can have properties like model, color, etc. We can define variables like $model, $color, and so on, to hold the values of these properties. When the individual objects (Volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc.) are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties. If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class. <?php class Car { public $color ; public $model ; public function __construct ( $color , $model ) { $this -> color = $color ; $this -> model = $model ; } public function message () { return \"My car is a \" . $this -> color . \" \" . $this -> model . \"!\" ; } } $myCar = new Car ( \"black\" , \"Volvo\" ); echo $myCar -> message (); echo \"<br>\" ; $myCar = new Car ( \"red\" , \"Toyota\" ); echo $myCar -> message (); ?> PHP NULL Value Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL. A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it. Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL. Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL PHP Resource The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP. A common example of using the resource data type is a database call. Type Casting PHP does not require explicit type definition in variable declaration. In this case, the type of a variable is determined by the value it stores. That is to say, if a string is assigned to variable $var, then $var is of type string. If afterwards an int value is assigned to $var, it will be of type int. Type casting converts the value to a chosen type by writing the type within parentheses before the value to convert. The casts allowed are: (int) - cast to int (bool) - cast to bool (float) - cast to float (string) - cast to string (array) - cast to array (object) - cast to object (unset) - cast to NULL <?php $bool_false = false ; $int_val = ( int ) $bool_false ; var_dump ( $int_val ); //Output will be 0 $bool_true = true ; $int_val = ( int ) $bool_true ; var_dump ( $int_val ); //Output will be 1 ?> Casting literal strings and variables to binary strings: <?php $binary = ( binary ) $string ; $binary = b \"binary string\" ; ?> Instead of casting a variable to a string, it is also possible to enclose the variable in double quotes. <?php $foo = 10 ; // $foo is an integer $str = \" $foo \" ; // $str is a string $fst = ( string ) $foo ; // $fst is also a string // This prints out that \"they are the same\" if ( $fst === $str ) { echo \"they are the same\" ; } ?>","title":"Data Types and Casting"},{"location":"PR/phpVar2/#data-types","text":"PHP supports the following data types: String Integer Float Boolean Array Object NULL Resource","title":"Data Types"},{"location":"PR/phpVar2/#php-string","text":"A string is a sequence of characters, like \"Hello world!\".

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.
