So, if you assign an integer value to a variable, the type of that variable will automatically be an integer. Then, if you assign a string to the same variable, the type will change to a string. This automatic conversion can sometimes break your code. PHP Integers An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 2147483647 in 32 bit systems, and between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer. Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5). Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0) PHP Integer Constants PHP has the following predefined constants for integers: PHP_INT_MAX - The largest integer supported PHP_INT_MIN - The smallest integer supported PHP_INT_SIZE - The size of an integer in bytes PHP Integer Functions PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer: is_int() is_integer() - alias of is_int() is_long() - alias of is_int() PHP Floats The float data type can commonly store a value up to 1.7976931348623E+308 (platform dependent), and have a maximum precision of 14 digits. PHP Float Constants PHP has the following predefined constants for floats (from PHP 7.2): PHP_FLOAT_MAX - The largest representable floating point number PHP_FLOAT_MIN - The smallest representable positive floating point number PHP_FLOAT_DIG - The number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a float and back without precision loss PHP_FLOAT_EPSILON - The smallest representable positive number x, so that x + 1.0 != 1.0 PHP Float Functions PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is float: is_float() is_double() - alias of is_float() PHP Infinity A numeric value that is larger than PHP_FLOAT_MAX is considered infinite. PHP has the following functions to check if a numeric value is finite or infinite: is_finite() is_infinite() <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php // Check if a numeric value is finite or infinite $x = 1.9e411 ; var_dump ( $x ); ?> </body> </html> PHP NaN NaN stands for Not a Number.

The function returns true if the variable is a number or a numeric string, false otherwise. From PHP 7.0: The is_numeric() function will return FALSE for numeric strings in hexadecimal form (e.g. 0xf4c3b00c), as they are no longer considered as numeric strings. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php // Check if the variable is numeric $x = 5985 ; var_dump ( is_numeric ( $x )); echo \"<br>\" ; $x = \"5985\" ; var_dump ( is_numeric ( $x )); echo \"<br>\" ; $x = \"59.85\" + 100 ; var_dump ( is_numeric ( $x )); echo \"<br>\" ; $x = \"Hello\" ; var_dump ( is_numeric ( $x )); ?> </body> </html> PHP Casting to Integers Sometimes you need to cast a numerical value into another data type.

As a simple case, we can assign a variable a value using the assignment operator, which is the \"equals\" sign. Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable: Remember that variables are case-sensitive! <?php $txt = \"Hello world!\" ; //No difference between \"\" and '' $x = 5 ; $y = 10.5 ; ?> After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, the variable $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5. Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value. Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Rules for PHP variables: A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character A variable name cannot start with a number A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables) Output Variables The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen. The following example will show how to output text and a variable: <?php $txt = \"phpTutorial\" ; echo \"I love $txt !\" ; ?> Tools for understanding strange objects var_dump() function var_dump() displays structured information about one or more expressions that includes its type and value.

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties. Let's assume we have a class named Car. A Car can have properties like model, color, etc. We can define variables like $model, $color, and so on, to hold the values of these properties. When the individual objects (Volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc.) are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties. If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class. <?php class Car { public $color ; public $model ; public function __construct ( $color , $model ) { $this -> color = $color ; $this -> model = $model ; } public function message () { return \"My car is a \" . $this -> color . \" \" . $this -> model . \"!\" ; } } $myCar = new Car ( \"black\" , \"Volvo\" ); echo $myCar -> message (); echo \"<br>\" ; $myCar = new Car ( \"red\" , \"Toyota\" ); echo $myCar -> message (); ?> PHP NULL Value Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL. A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it. Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL. Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL PHP Resource The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP. A common example of using the resource data type is a database call. Type Casting PHP does not require explicit type definition in variable declaration. In this case, the type of a variable is determined by the value it stores. That is to say, if a string is assigned to variable $var, then $var is of type string. If afterwards an int value is assigned to $var, it will be of type int. Type casting converts the value to a chosen type by writing the type within parentheses before the value to convert.

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.
