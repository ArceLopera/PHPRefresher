Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

[Arithmetic operators](#php-arithmetic-operators)
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Increment/Decrement operators
Logical operators
String operators
Array operators
Conditional assignment operators


## PHP Arithmetic Operators

The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

| Operator | Description |Example|Result|
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| `+` | Addition | $x + $y | Sum of $x and $y|  
| `-` | Subtraction | $x - $y | Difference of $x and $y |
| `*` | Multiplication | $x * $y | Product of $x and $y |
| `/` | Division | $x / $y | Quotient of $x and $y |
| `%` | Modulus | $x % $y | Remainder of $x divided by $y |
| `**` | Exponentiation | $x ** $y | $x to the power of $y |

## PHP Assignment Operators
The PHP assignment operators are used with numeric values to write a value to a variable.

The basic assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right.

| Operator | Description |Example|Result|
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| `=` | Assignment | $x = $y | Assign $y to $x |
| `+=` | Addition Assignment | $x += $y | Add $y to $x and assign the result to $x |
| `-=` | Subtraction Assignment | $x -= $y | Subtract $y from $x and assign the result to $x |
| `*=` | Multiplication Assignment | $x *= $y | Multiply $x by $y and assign the result to $x |
| `/=` | Division Assignment | $x /= $y | Divide $x by $y and assign the result to $x |
| `%=` | Modulus Assignment | $x %= $y | Modulus of $x divided by $y and assign the result to $x |
