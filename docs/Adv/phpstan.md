In the world of PHP development, ensuring code quality and catching potential bugs early can save countless hours of debugging and troubleshooting. **PHPStan** is one of the most powerful tools available for this purpose. It provides **static analysis** for PHP code, helping developers detect issues before the code is even executed.

## What is PHPStan?

PHPStan is a **static analysis tool** for PHP. Unlike traditional debugging tools that catch errors at runtime, PHPStan analyzes your code **without executing it**. It looks for potential issues, such as:
- Undefined variables
- Incorrect method calls
- Type mismatches
- Unused code
- PHPDoc inconsistencies

It operates at different **levels of strictness**, allowing developers to progressively improve their code quality over time.

## Why Use PHPStan?

### âœ… Detect Errors Before Execution
PHPStan helps identify common PHP errors before your code runs, reducing the chances of production failures.

### ðŸš€ Improve Code Quality
By enforcing best practices and identifying unused code, PHPStan encourages cleaner, more maintainable codebases.

### âš¡ Enhance Performance
Finding and fixing inefficiencies during development leads to better performance and reduced debugging time.

### ðŸŽ¯ Customize to Your Needs
PHPStan allows you to configure its rules and adjust strictness levels according to your project's needs.

## Installing PHPStan

The simplest way to install PHPStan is via **Composer**. Run the following command in your project:

```bash
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
```

Once installed, you can check your code by running:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src/
```

Replace `src/` with the directory containing your PHP code.

## Configuring PHPStan

To customize PHPStan, create a `phpstan.neon` configuration file in your project's root directory:

```neon
parameters:
    level: 5  # Adjust the strictness level (0 to 9)
    paths:
        - src  # Directory to scan
    ignoreErrors:
        - '#Variable \$cfg might not be defined#'  # Example of ignoring specific errors
```

Then, run:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

## Understanding PHPStan Levels

PHPStan operates at different **levels of strictness**, ranging from **level 0** (basic checks) to **level 9** (strictest checks). Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

| Level | Checks for |
|-------|-----------|
| 0     | Basic syntax issues |
| 1     | Undefined variables, incorrect function calls |
| 2     | Undefined class properties |
| 3     | Function return types |
| 4     | More detailed type checks |
| 5     | Stricter array and object checks |
| 6     | Nullable types and advanced return value checks |
| 7     | More stringent checks on mixed types |
| 8     | Deep property analysis |
| 9     | Maximum strictness |

## Example Usage

Consider the following PHP code:

```php
function greetUser(string $name) {
    return 'Hello, ' . $username; // Error: $username is undefined
}

echo greetUser('Alice');
```

Running PHPStan will output:

```
 ------ -------------------------------------
  Line   example.php
 ------ -------------------------------------
  2      Variable $username might not be defined.
 ------ -------------------------------------
```

To fix this, ensure the correct variable is used:

```php
function greetUser(string $name) {
    return 'Hello, ' . $name;
}
```

---

## Ignoring Specific Errors

If PHPStan reports false positives or issues you intentionally want to ignore, use `ignoreErrors` in `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
parameters:
  ignoreErrors:
    - '#Variable \$cfg might not be defined#'
```

This is useful for legacy codebases where fixing everything at once is impractical.

## Advanced Features

### PHPStan Extensions
PHPStan has various extensions for frameworks and tools, including:
- Laravel: `composer require --dev nunomaduro/larastan`
- Symfony: `composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-symfony`
- Doctrine: `composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-doctrine`

### Custom Rules
You can define **custom rules** to enforce your teamâ€™s coding standards. Check out the [official PHPStan documentation](https://phpstan.org/) for details.
