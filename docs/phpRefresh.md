PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

``` php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <?php
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?>

    </body>
</html>
```

PHP is lossly typed (i.e. types are not necessarily enforced), dynamically, implicitly typed (i.e. you donâ€™t have to declare variables), case sensitive (i.e. var and VAR are two different variables) and object-oriented (i.e. everything is an object, like C# and Java).

PHP is a language like C that uses curly braces to contain code statements within loops or conditionals.
