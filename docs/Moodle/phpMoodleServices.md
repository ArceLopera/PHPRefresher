External web services in Moodle allow the platform to interact with external systems, 
providing a bridge for integrating Moodle with third-party applications such as mobile apps, 
external platforms, or custom systems. Moodle uses a standardized way to define, expose, 
and secure web services to ensure safe communication between systems.

Developing an external web service in Moodle involves several steps, including defining 
the functions to be exposed, creating the necessary security mechanisms, and managing 
user permissions. The Web Service framework and the External API work closely together providing a number of Endpoints, 
and self-describing classes to support a wide range of uses.

Moodle uses these web services internally for:

+ AJAX interactions in the Moodle Web Interface; and
+ The official Moodle Mobile App.

The following example shows a typical authentication and protocol workflow.

![auth-protocol](../Images/protocolworkflow.bmp)

The External Service API has two categories of documentation:

+ this documentation details how to write a web service and use the External API; and
+ API documentation for a live Moodle site, which can be found under ** Site administration > Server > Web services > API Documentation **.

### **Web Service Protocols**

Moodle supports multiple web service protocols, which determine how external systems 
can communicate with Moodle. Common protocols include:

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A simple, lightweight protocol that uses HTTP 
requests (GET, POST, etc.).
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A more complex, XML-based protocol.
- **XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**: Uses XML to encode calls and HTTP as the transport mechanism.
- **AMF (Action Message Format)**: A binary protocol primarily used for communication with Flash applications.

Moodle comes with built-in support for these protocols, and developers can configure which ones to use.

### **Defining Web Service Functions**

A web service function is a PHP function that handles the logic of your web service. You can expose any PHP function in Moodle 
as a web service function, but it must be carefully structured to ensure security and proper behavior.

Before they can be used, all functions must be *declared* to Moodle, and their inputs and outputs must be *defined*.

+ Functions are *declared* by noting them in the `db/services.php` file for a plugin.
+ Functions are *defined* within their own class located within the `\component\external` namespace of a component.

Note that there is a [strict naming convention for external service functions](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Web_service_API_functions#Naming_convention).

Function implementation classes consist of one class containing a number of functions, some of which are mandatory.

During a Moodle installation or upgrade, the service and function declarations are parsed by a service discovery process 
and stored within the database. An administrative UI may be used to change some configuration details of these declarations.

### **Service declarations**

Each component wishing to create an external service function must declare that the function exists by describing 
it in the `db/services.php` file for that component.

This information is stored internally within Moodle, and collected as part of the service discovery during installation 
and upgrade. The function name is arbitrary, but must follow the naming convention. This helps ensure that it is globally unique.

``` php
$functions = [
// The name of your web service function, as discussed above.
'local_myplugin_create_groups' => [
    // The name of the namespaced class that the function is located in.
    'classname'   => 'local_groupmanager\external\create_groups',

    // A brief, human-readable, description of the web service function.
    'description' => 'Creates new groups.',

    // Options include read, and write.
    'type'        => 'write',

    // Whether the service is available for use in AJAX calls from the web.
    'ajax'        => true,

    // An optional list of services where the function will be included.
    'services'    => [
        // A standard Moodle install includes one default service:
        // - MOODLE_OFFICIAL_MOBILE_SERVICE.
        // Specifying this service means that your function will be available for
        // use in the Moodle Mobile App.
        MOODLE_OFFICIAL_MOBILE_SERVICE,
        ],
    // A comma-separated list of capabilities used by the function.
    // This is advisory only and used to indicate to the administrator
    // configuring a custom service definition.
    'capabilities' => 'moodle/course:creategroups,moodle/course:managegroups',

    // The following parameters are also available, but are no longer recommended.

    // The name of the external function name.
    // If not specified, this will default to 'execute'.
    'methodname'  => 'execute',

    // The file containing the class/external function.
    // Do not use if using namespaced auto-loading classes.
    'classpath'   => 'local/groupmanager/externallib.php',
    ),
);
```

### **Function Definitions**

An External function definition is the class, and collection of functions, used to define:

+ any parameters that the function expects to take, including any types
+ what the function will return, including any types
+ whether the function has been deprecated, or not

It also includes the code that will actually be executed by the function.

The function definition should be located within the external namespace of a component.
For a component named local_groupmanager located in local/groupmanager which is responsible for creating groups on request, you may have:

- a Web service function named: local_groupmanager_create_groups
- defined in a class named local_groupmanager\external\create_groups
- which is located local/groupmanager/classes/external/create_groups.php

A service definition:

+ must extend the \core_external\external_api class
+ must declare an execute_parameters function to describe the expected parameters of the function
+ must declare an execute function which is called with the functions and performs the expected actions
+ must declare an execute_returns function to describe the values returned by the function
+ may declare an execute_is_deprecated function to declare a function as deprecated

Writing plugins supporting Multiple Moodle versions
The External API subsystem was restructured in Moodle 4.2 and moved from classes within a manually-required file, to autoloaded and namespaced classes.

If you are developing a plugin whose codebase is used or tested in multiple Moodle versions, including older versions of Moodle, then you:

+ must require_once the lib/externallib.php file
+ must extend the external_api class instead of \core_external\external_api

This will allow your plugin to continue working without deprecation notices or failures.

Please note that deprecation notices will be added to this pathway from Moodle 4.6 onwards.

```php
// local/groupmanager/classes/external/create_groups.php
<?php

namespace local_groupmanager\external;

use external_function_parameters;
use external_multiple_structure;
use external_single_structure;
use external_value;

class create_groups extends \core_external\external_api {
    public static function execute_parameters(): external_function_parameters {
        return new external_function_parameters([
            'groups' => new external_multiple_structure(
                new external_single_structure([
                    'courseid'  => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'The course to create the group for'),
                    'idnumber'    => new external_value(
                        PARAM_RAW,
                        'An arbitrary ID code number perhaps from the institution',
                        VALUE_DEFAULT,
                        null
                    ),
                    'name' => new external_value(
                        PARAM_RAW,
                        'The name of the group'
                    ),
                    'description' => new external_value(
                        PARAM_TEXT,
                        'A description',
                        VALUE_OPTIONAL
                    ),
                ]),
                'A list of groups to create'
            ),
        ]);
    }

    public static function execute(array $groups): array {
        // Validate all of the parameters.
        [
            'groups' => $groups,
        ] = self::validate_parameters(self::execute_parameters(), [
            'groups' => $groups,
        ]);

        // Perform security checks, for example:
        $coursecontext = \context_course::instance($courseid);
        self::validate_context($coursecontext);
        require_capability('moodle/course:creategroups', $coursecontext);

        // Create the group using existing Moodle APIs.
        $createdgroups = \local_groupmanager\util::create_groups($groups);

        // Return a value as described in the returns function.
        return [
            'groups' => $createdgroups,
        ];
    }

    public static function execute_returns(): external_single_structure {
        return new external_single_structure([
            'groups' => new external_multiple_structure([
                'id' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Id of the created user'),
                'name' => new external_value(PARAM_RAW, 'The name of the group'),
            ])
        ]);
    }
}
```
Available parameter types are defined in lib/moodlelib.php and are used by the 
validate_parameters() function and during return value checking to ensure that the 
service is called and working as defined.


### **Security Considerations**

Web services often expose sensitive data, so itâ€™s critical to enforce strict security measures.

- **User Authentication**: Ensure that only authorized users can access your web services.
- **Capability Checks**: Use Moodleâ€™s capabilities system to control access. For example, only users with the capability `moodle/course:view` can retrieve course details.
- **Parameter Validation**: Always validate and sanitize the input parameters using the `external_function_parameters` class.
- **Return Value Sanitization**: Ensure that the data returned is safe and free from XSS vulnerabilities.


Before operating on any data in an external function, you must ensure that the user:

- has access to context that the data is located in
- has permission to perform the relevant action

#### Validating function parameters
Before working with any data provided by a user you must validate the parameters against the 
definitions you have defined.

To do so you should call the `validate_parameters()` function, passing in the reference to 
your `execute_parameters()` function, and the complete list of parameters for the function. 
The function will return the validated and cleaned parameters.

The validate_parameters() function is defined on the `\core_external\external_api` class, 
and can be called as follows:

```php
// local/groupmanager/classes/external/create_groups.php
public static function execute(array $groups): array {
    [
        'groups' => $groups,
    ] = self::validate_parameters(self::execute_parameters(), [
        'groups' => $groups,
    ]);
    // ...
}

```

#### Validating access to the Moodle context

Whenever fetching or updating any data within Moodle using an External function definition, 
you must validate the context that the data exists within.

To do so you should call the validate_context() function, passing the most specific context 
for the data.

For example, if you are working with data belonging to a specific activity, you should use 
the activity context. If you are working with data belonging to a course, you should use 
the course context.

If your function operates on multiple contexts (like a list of courses), you must validate 
each context right before generating any response data related to that context.

The `validate_context()` function is defined on the `\core_external\external_api` class, 
and can be called as follows:

```php
// local/groupmanager/classes/external/create_groups.php
public static function execute(array $groups): array {
    // ...
    foreach ($groups as $group) {
        $coursecontext = \context_course::instance($group['courseid']);
        self::validate_context($coursecontext);
        // ...
    }
}
```

The validate_context() function will also configure 
the correct theme, language, and filters required to render content for the current user.

You should not:

- use the require_login function from an external function - this function is reserved for php scripts returning a web page.
- call $PAGE->set_context() manually - this will generate warning notices.

The `validate_context()` function is the only correct way to write external functions.

#### Ensuring that a user has the appropriate rights

Once you have confirmed that the provided data is of the correct type, and configured Moodle for the specific context, you should also ensure that all capabilities are checked correctly.

You can use the standard capability functions, including:

- has_capability() - to check that a user has a single capability
- has_any_capability() - to check that a user has any capability in a set
- has_all_capability() - to check that a user has all capabilities in a set
- require_capability() - to require a single capability
- require_all_capabilities() - to require that a user has all capabilities in a set

### **Managing Access Control**

Each web service function can have specific access controls that determine who can call it. Access is controlled via **tokens** and **capabilities**.

- **Tokens**: Users or systems must have a valid token to call a web service. Admins can issue these tokens through **Site administration > Server > Web services > Manage tokens**.
- **Capabilities**: Each function can define required capabilities in `db/services.php`, ensuring that users have the correct roles to access the web service.

#### **Authentication and Tokens**

Moodle uses tokens for authenticating users when they access web services. Tokens are generated for individual users or system accounts 
and can be issued in two ways:

- **Manually** by administrators: Through the admin interface.
- **Automatically**: Using Moodleâ€™s authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2).

**Example: Creating a Token Manually**

1. Go to **Site administration > Server > Web services > Manage tokens**.
2. Choose the user for whom the token will be created.
3. Assign the web service functions that this token allows access to.


#### **Service Configuration in the Moodle Admin Interface**

After defining your web service functions, you can configure them via the Moodle admin interface:

- **Enable Web Services**: Ensure web services are enabled in **Site administration > Advanced features**.
- **Configure Protocols**: Enable the desired web service protocols under **Site administration > Plugins > Web services > Manage protocols**.
- **Create a Service**: In **Site administration > Server > Web services > External services**, you can create and manage services, which are groups of related web service functions.
- **Assign Functions to the Service**: Add the functions defined in `db/services.php` to the service, so they are accessible externally.
---

### **File handling**

Moodle provides two ways to fetch and upload files:

1. A set of web service functions; and
2. A pair of dedicated endpoints.

#### Web service functions

You can use the following functions to upload, and fetch, file content:

+ `core_files_get_files()`; and
+ `core_files_upload()`.

When using these functions, the file content is base64-encoded.

**Note: **
Many devices do not have enough memory to encode and decode requests containing large files. 
As such we recommend using the dedicated endpoints instead.

#### Dedicated endpoints

Moodle provides two dedicated endpoints which can be used, alongside the authentication token, to upload and fetch content. These are:

+ to upload a file: `/webservice/upload.php`; and
+ to fetch a file: `/webservice/pluginfile.php`.

##### File upload

The recommended way to upload file content from an external service is by issue a `POST` request to the `/webservice/upload.php` endpoint, 
passing in a valid web service token for authentication.

Upon successful upload, any files passed will be saved in the user's draft file area.

The endpoint takes two optional arguments:

+ An `itemid` to upload the files to, defaulting to `0`. If none is specified then a new id is generated for the current user's draft file area
+ A `filepath` to store the file in, defaulting to /.

The endpoint will return a JSON-encoded summary of the uploaded file, including the `itemid` that it was stored in.

It is typical that the `itemid` parameter will be used when the files are uploaded singularly in separate HTTP calls 
and the files are required to be in the same draft file area.

The client retrieves the `itemid` from the first uploaded file and uses it in subsequent uploads.

This allows multiple files to be uploaded to the same draft file area.

On every successful upload, the file/s information are returned in JSON format. 
If an error occurs, an error message will be sent back in JSON format too.

##### Example
To upload a file, `users.csv`, you could use curl as follows:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -F "file_1=@users.csv" https://SITENAME/webservice/upload.php?token=TOKEN \
| jq

[
  {
    "component": "user",
    "contextid": 567,
    "userid": "123",
    "filearea": "draft",
    "filename": "users.csv",
    "filepath": "/",
    "itemid": 880413555,
    "license": "allrightsreserved",
    "author": "User User",
    "source": "O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:6:\"source\";s:13:\"users.csv\";}"
  }
]
```

The returned JSON response includes the key parts of the file record, including the `itemid`.

Once all the files are uploaded, you can call a webserivce function to process the files from the user drafts area, 
passing in the `itemid` of the draft area containing the list of files for the request. 
The service can identify the uploads and manipulate them as necessary.

An example of a webservice that accepts files is: `mod_assign_save_submission`.

To accept file uploads, the service must allow "files download" 
(Administration > Plugins > Web services > Manage services > Edit service > Advanced button)

##### File download
We serve the files through `/webservice/pluginfile.php`. This script requires a web service token for authentication.

To support file downloads, the service must allow "files download".

The `/webservice/pluginfile.php` endpoint has the exact same structure as `/pluginfile.php` and `/tokenpluginfile.php`.

We don't serve the files through `/pluginfile.php` for web service clients because it requires the user's login session to work, 
however it is possible to use the `/tokenpluginfile.php` endpoint with an appropriate token.

##### Returning files in Web Services
Since Moodle 3.2, you can return a complete file area list via Web Services using the static `get_area_files` method, defined in `external_util`.

```php
$forum->introfiles = external_util::get_area_files($context->id, 'mod_forum', 'intro', false, false);
```

You can also use the `external_files` structure definition in combination with the method to return the most common file fields 
required by WS clients.

```php
public static function execute_returns(): external_multiple_structure {
    return new external_multiple_structure(
        new external_single_structure([
            'id' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Forum id'),
            // ...
            'introfiles' => new external_files('Files in the introduction text', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
            // ...
        ])
    );
}
```

---


### **Testing**

To test web services:
- Use **Postman** or similar tools to make HTTP requests to the Moodle web services endpoint.
- Verify token validity and function calls.
- Use **Moodleâ€™s web service test client** (available in **Site administration > Server > Web services > Manage services**) to 
manually test the functions.
