## Developing with Moodle

Developing a plugin for Moodle involves several steps, from setting up your development environment to coding and testing your plugin. Moodle plugins are essentially PHP scripts that extend the functionality of the Moodle learning management system. Below is a detailed guide to help you develop a Moodle plugin:

### [Setting Up Your Development Environment](phpMoodleInstall.md)

**Requirements**

- **PHP**: Moodle is written in PHP, so you'll need PHP installed.
- **Database**: Moodle supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and Oracle. You'll need one of these databases.
- **Web Server**: Apache or Nginx is commonly used.
- **Moodle Installation**: You need a local Moodle instance for development and testing.


### [Understanding Moodle Plugin Types](phpMoodlePluginTypes.md)

Moodle supports various types of plugins:

- **Activity Modules**: Add new activities (e.g., assignments, quizzes).
- **Blocks**: Add new blocks to the Moodle interface.
- **Themes**: Customize the look and feel of Moodle.
- **Reports**: Create new reports.
- **Auth Plugins**: Implement custom authentication methods.
- **Enrol Plugins**: Implement custom enrollment methods.

Choose the plugin type based on the functionality you want to add.

### [Creating the Plugin Skeleton](phpMoodlePluginSkeleton.md)

Moodle provides a command-line tool and plugin to generate the initial plugin skeleton. You can also manually create the necessary files and folders.

#### Directory Structure
Each plugin type has a specific directory structure. For example, for an activity module:

```
moodle/
├── mod/
│   ├── yourpluginname/
│   │   ├── db/
│   │   ├── lang/
│   │   ├── backup/
│   │   ├── classes/
│   │   ├── pix/
│   │   ├── version.php
│   │   ├── index.php
│   │   ├── view.php
│   │   ├── lib.php
│   │   ├── settings.php
│   │   ├── ...
```

### [Writing Your Plugin Code](phpMoodlePluginFiles.md)

#### Essential Files
- **version.php**: Defines the plugin version and other metadata.
- **db/install.xml**: Defines database tables needed by your plugin.
- **lang/en/yourpluginname.php**: Contains language strings.
- **index.php**: Entry point for your plugin.
- **view.php**: Displays the main content.
- **lib.php**: Contains core functions used by your plugin.

#### version.php
```php
<?php
defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();

$plugin->version   = 2024053000; // The current plugin version (Date: YYYYMMDDXX).
$plugin->requires  = 2021051700; // Requires this Moodle version.
$plugin->component = 'mod_yourpluginname'; // Full name of the plugin (used for diagnostics).
$plugin->maturity  = MATURITY_STABLE;
$plugin->release   = 'v1.0';
```

#### db/install.xml
Define your database schema:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<XMLDB PATH="mod/yourpluginname/db" VERSION="2024053000" COMMENT="Your plugin description">
    <TABLES>
        <TABLE NAME="yourpluginname_table">
            <FIELDS>
                <FIELD NAME="id" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true" SEQUENCE="true"/>
                <FIELD NAME="name" TYPE="char" LENGTH="255" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT=""/>
                <FIELD NAME="intro" TYPE="text" NOTNULL="false"/>
                <FIELD NAME="timecreated" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT="0"/>
            </FIELDS>
            <KEYS>
                <KEY NAME="primary" TYPE="primary" FIELDS="id"/>
            </KEYS>
        </TABLE>
    </TABLES>
</XMLDB>
```

#### lang/en/yourpluginname.php
```php
<?php
$string['modulename'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
$string['modulenameplural'] = 'Your Plugin Names';
$string['pluginname'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
```

#### index.php
```php
<?php
require('../../config.php');
require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/mod/yourpluginname/lib.php');

$id = required_param('id', PARAM_INT);

$PAGE->set_url('/mod/yourpluginname/index.php', array('id' => $id));
$PAGE->set_title('Your Plugin Name');
$PAGE->set_heading('Your Plugin Name');

echo $OUTPUT->header();
echo $OUTPUT->heading('Your Plugin Name');

echo 'Hello, Moodle!';
echo $OUTPUT->footer();
```

### Adding Functionality

Depending on your plugin type, you will add different functionalities. For an activity module, you might need to create forms for adding and updating records, views to display data, and so on. Utilize Moodle's API for database operations, form handling, and more.

#### Example: Adding a Form
```php
<?php
require_once("$CFG->libdir/formslib.php");

class mod_yourpluginname_form extends moodleform {
    function definition() {
        $mform = $this->_form;
        
        $mform->addElement('text', 'name', get_string('name'));
        $mform->setType('name', PARAM_NOTAGS);
        $mform->addRule('name', null, 'required', null, 'client');
        
        $mform->addElement('editor', 'intro', get_string('intro'));
        $mform->setType('intro', PARAM_RAW);

        $this->add_action_buttons();
    }
}
```

### Testing and Debugging

Enable debugging in Moodle (`$CFG->debug = DEBUG_DEVELOPER;`) to see detailed error messages. Test your plugin thoroughly by creating different scenarios and ensuring all functionalities work as expected.

### Packaging and Distributing

To distribute your plugin:

1. **Create a ZIP file** of your plugin directory.
2. **Ensure all necessary files** are included and version numbers are correct.
3. **Upload your plugin** to the Moodle Plugin Directory for sharing with the Moodle community.

### Documentation and Maintenance

Provide clear documentation for your plugin, including installation instructions, usage guides, and troubleshooting tips. Regularly maintain and update your plugin to ensure compatibility with new Moodle versions.

### Additional Resources

- **Moodle Developer Documentation**: [Moodle Dev Docs](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Main_Page)
- **Moodle API Documentation**: [Moodle API](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Core_APIs)
- **Moodle Forum**: [Moodle Community](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/index.php?id=5)

Developing a Moodle plugin can be a complex but rewarding process. By following these steps and utilizing the resources available, you can create powerful and flexible extensions to enhance the Moodle experience.
