Writing the code for a Moodle plugin involves creating and configuring several essential files that define the plugin's behavior, data structure, language strings, and core functionality. 

- [**version.php**](#versionphp): Defines the plugin version and other metadata.
- [**lang/en/yourpluginname.php**](#langenyourpluginnamephp): Contains language strings.
- [**lib.php**](#libphp): Contains core functions used by your plugin.
- [**db/install.xml**](#dbinstallxml): Defines database tables needed by your plugin.
- [**index.php**](#indexphp): Entry point for your plugin.
- [**view.php**](#viewphp): Displays the main content.

### `version.php`

The `version.php` file is crucial for defining a Moodle plugin's metadata, including its version, dependencies, required Moodle version, and other important information. This file enables Moodle to recognize, manage, and update the plugin appropriately.

**Structure of `version.php`**

```php
<?php
defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();

$plugin->version   = 2024053001;  // Updated version for new release.
$plugin->requires  = 2021051700;  // Minimum Moodle version required.
$plugin->component = 'mod_yourpluginname'; // Unique name of the plugin.
$plugin->maturity  = MATURITY_STABLE;  // Indicates stability of the plugin.
$plugin->release   = 'v1.1';  // Human-readable version number.
$plugin->dependencies = [
    'mod_otherplugin' => 2023031500,  // This plugin depends on another plugin.
    'mod_anotherplugin' => 2022010100,  // Another dependency.
];
```

+ **File Guard** - Required

   ```php
   defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();
   ```
   Ensures the file is accessed through the Moodle system and not directly via a URL, enhancing security.
   Always include this line at the beginning of your `version.php` file.

+ **Version** - Required

   ```php
   $plugin->version = 2024053000;
   ```

Specifies the current version of your plugin. The format `YYYYMMDDXX` (Year, Month, Day, Incremental Sequence) is typically used.
Update this value for every new release or update of your plugin. The format helps in sorting and identifying the latest version easily.

+ **Requires** - Recommended

   ```php
   $plugin->requires = 2021051700;
   ```
Defines the minimum version of Moodle required for your plugin to work correctly.
Set this to the earliest Moodle version that supports all the features and APIs used by your plugin. Always verify compatibility during testing.

+ **Component** - Required

   ```php
   $plugin->component = 'mod_yourpluginname';
   ```

Specifies the full name of the plugin, including its type and name. The format is usually `type_pluginname` (e.g., `mod_yourpluginname` for an activity plugin). The component value contains the name of the plugin in its full frankenstyle format.
This name must be unique across all plugins in Moodle. It helps in identifying the plugin during installation, upgrade, and diagnostics.

+ **Maturity** - Recommended

   ```php
   $plugin->maturity = MATURITY_STABLE;
   ```

Indicates the stability and readiness level of the plugin. Common values are `MATURITY_ALPHA`, `MATURITY_BETA`, `MATURITY_RC` (Release Candidate), and `MATURITY_STABLE`.
Set this appropriately based on the development stage of your plugin. Use `MATURITY_STABLE` for production-ready versions, and other values for pre-release stages.

+ **Release** - Recommended

   ```php
   $plugin->release = 'v1.0';
   ```

Provides a human-readable version number for your plugin. This is useful for administrators and users to understand the versioning scheme and changes at a glance.
Follow semantic versioning principles (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`) to indicate major, minor, and patch updates clearly.

+ **Peer Dependencies** - Optional

   ```php
   $plugin->dependencies = array(
       'mod_otherplugin' => 2023031500,
   );
   ```

Specifies other plugins that your plugin depends on, including their required versions. This ensures that the necessary plugins are present and meet the required versions for your plugin to function correctly.
List all dependencies with their respective minimum required versions. This helps prevent conflicts and ensures a smooth installation process.

+ **Supported versions** - Optional

A set of branch numbers to specify the lowest and highest branches of Moodle that the plugin supports. These value are inclusive.

   ```php
    $plugin->supported = [

        // Support from the Moodle 3.11 series.
        311,

        // To the Moodle 4.0 series.
        400,
    ];
   ```

+ **Incompatible versions** - Optional

The earliest incompatible version of Moodle that the plugin cannot support the specified branch of Moodle.

The plugin will not be installable on any versions of Moodle from this point on.

   ```php
    $plugin->incompatible = [401];
   ```

### `lang/en/yourpluginname.php`

The `lang/en/yourpluginname.php` file is crucial for handling the language strings used by your Moodle plugin. This file contains all the text that will be displayed to users, allowing for easy translation and localization. Properly managing this file ensures that your plugin can support multiple languages and provides a consistent user experience.

```php
<?php
$string['modulename'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
$string['modulenameplural'] = 'Your Plugin Names';
$string['pluginname'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
$string['modulename_help'] = 'Use the Your Plugin Name module to do something useful.';
$string['yourpluginname:addinstance'] = 'Add a new Your Plugin Name';
$string['yourpluginname:submit'] = 'Submit Your Plugin Name';
$string['yourpluginname:view'] = 'View Your Plugin Name';
$string['someadminsetting'] = 'Some admin setting';
$string['someadminsetting_desc'] = 'Description of some admin setting.';
$string['field_required'] = 'This field is required.';
$string['error_invalidinput'] = 'Invalid input provided.';
$string['welcome_message'] = 'Welcome to Your Plugin Name!';
$string['goodbye_message'] = 'Thank you for using Your Plugin Name.';
```
The get_string API can be used to translate a string identifier back into a translated string.
See the [String API documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/String_API#Adding_language_file_to_plugin) for more information on language files.

+ **Module Name**

Every plugin must define the name of the plugin, or its pluginname.

   ```php
   $string['modulename'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
   $string['modulenameplural'] = 'Your Plugin Names';
   $string['pluginname'] = 'Your Plugin Name';
   ```

Defines the name of your plugin and its plural form, which Moodle uses in various parts of the interface, such as the activity chooser.
Choose a clear and descriptive name that conveys the functionality of your plugin.

**ACTIVITY MODULES ARE DIFFERENT**

Activity modules do not use the frankenstyle name as a filename, they use the plugin name. For example the forum activity plugin:

```php
// Plugin type: `mod`
// Plugin name: `forum`
// Frankenstyle plugin name: `mod_forum`
// Plugin location: `mod/forum`
// Language string location: `mod/forum/lang/en/forum.php`
```

+ **Help Strings**

   ```php
   $string['modulename_help'] = 'Use the Your Plugin Name module to do something useful.';
   ```

 Provides help text or tooltips that offer additional information about your plugin.
 Write concise and informative help strings to assist users in understanding how to use the plugin.

+ **Capability Strings**

   ```php
   $string['yourpluginname:addinstance'] = 'Add a new Your Plugin Name';
   $string['yourpluginname:submit'] = 'Submit Your Plugin Name';
   $string['yourpluginname:view'] = 'View Your Plugin Name';
   ```

 Defines capability strings that are used for permissions and roles in Moodle. These strings describe the actions that users can perform with your plugin.
 Clearly define the capabilities required for different user roles and ensure they are consistent with the plugin's functionality.

+ **Admin Settings Strings**

   ```php
   $string['someadminsetting'] = 'Some admin setting';
   $string['someadminsetting_desc'] = 'Description of some admin setting.';
   ```

Defines language strings for admin settings, including descriptions that explain what each setting does.
Provide clear and detailed descriptions to help administrators configure the plugin correctly.

+ **Form Validation and Error Messages**

   ```php
   $string['field_required'] = 'This field is required.';
   $string['error_invalidinput'] = 'Invalid input provided.';
   ```

Provides language strings for form validation and error messages to inform users of required fields and input errors.
 Use straightforward and unambiguous language to ensure users understand what is required or what went wrong.

+ **Custom Messages**

   ```php
   $string['welcome_message'] = 'Welcome to Your Plugin Name!';
   $string['goodbye_message'] = 'Thank you for using Your Plugin Name.';
   ```

Defines custom messages that can be displayed to users at various points in your plugin.
Tailor these messages to enhance the user experience and provide helpful information.

**Best Practices for `lang/en/yourpluginname.php`**

- **Consistency**: Ensure that the language keys (`$string['key']`) are consistent and follow a clear naming convention, usually `pluginname:key`.
- **Localization**: Include all user-facing text in this file to support easy localization and translation into other languages.
- **Clarity**: Write clear and concise language strings that accurately describe the plugin's functionality and provide helpful information to users.
- **Documentation**: Document each string with comments if necessary to explain its purpose and context, especially if the string's usage might not be immediately obvious.
- **Testing**: Regularly test your plugin with different language packs to ensure that all strings are translated and displayed correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can create a comprehensive and well-organized `lang/en/yourpluginname.php` file that supports effective localization and enhances the user experience of your Moodle plugin.

### `lib.php`

The `lib.php` file contains core functions used by your plugin, such as adding, updating, and deleting instances, and other helper functions. File path: /lib.php
The lib.php file is a legacy file which acts as a bridge between Moodle core, and the plugin. In recent plugins it should only be used to define callbacks and related functionality which currently is not supported as an auto-loadable class. For example, the navigationlib loads lib.php files for all plugin types that are able to inject their own nodes into the navigation tree (the file must be loaded to see if the corresponding *_extend_navigation() function is provided).

**PERFORMANCE IMPACT**
Moodle core often loads all the lib.php files of a given plugin types. For performance reasons, it is strongly recommended to keep this file as small as possible and have just required code implemented in it. All the plugin's internal logic should be implemented in the auto-loaded classes. The best advice is to put as much of your code as possible into classes, so you can use the [automatic class loading](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Automatic_class_loading)

#### locallib.php
Global support functions used by all plugins. File path: /locallib.php
The use of this file is no longer recommended, and new uses of it will not be permitted in core code. Rather than creating global functions in a global namespace in a locallib.php file, you should use autoloaded classes which are located in the classes/ directory.



### `db/install.xml`

The `install.xml` file defines the database schema for your plugin. This file is used by Moodle to create the necessary database tables when the plugin is installed.
Always remember that when creating or updating the install.xml you must use the built-in [XMLDB editor](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/XMLDB_Documentation) within Moodle.

**Example Content**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<XMLDB PATH="mod/yourpluginname/db" VERSION="2024053000" COMMENT="Your Plugin Name activity module">
    <TABLES>
        <TABLE NAME="yourpluginname">
            <FIELDS>
                <FIELD NAME="id" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true" SEQUENCE="true"/>
                <FIELD NAME="course" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true"/>
                <FIELD NAME="name" TYPE="char" LENGTH="255" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT=""/>
                <FIELD NAME="intro" TYPE="text" NOTNULL="false"/>
                <FIELD NAME="introformat" TYPE="int" LENGTH="4" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT="0"/>
                <FIELD NAME="timecreated" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT="0"/>
                <FIELD NAME="timemodified" TYPE="int" LENGTH="10" NOTNULL="true" DEFAULT="0"/>
            </FIELDS>
            <KEYS>
                <KEY NAME="primary" TYPE="primary" FIELDS="id"/>
            </KEYS>
        </TABLE>
    </TABLES>
</XMLDB>
```
### `db/upgrade.php`

File path: /db/upgrade.php
The db/upgrade.php file contains upgrade steps, including database schema changes, changes to settings, and other steps which must be performed during upgrade.

See the [Upgrade API documentation](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/guides/upgrade) for further information.

**GENERATING DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES**

When making changes to the database schema you must use the build-in XMLDB editor within Moodle. This can be used to generate php upgrade steps.

The install.xml schema must match the schema generated by the upgrade at all times.

To create an upgrade step you must:

+ Use the XMLDB editor to create the definition of the new fields
+ Update the install.xml from the XMLDB editor
+ Generate the PHP upgrade steps from within the XMLDB Editor
+ Update the version number in your version.php

In many cases you will be able to combine multiple upgrade steps into a single version change.

When a version number increment is detected during an upgrade, the xmldb_[pluginname]_upgrade function is called with the old version number as the first argument.

### `index.php`

The `index.php` file serves as an entry point for your plugin. It typically lists all instances of the plugin in a course.

**Example Content**

```php
<?php
require('../../config.php');
require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/mod/yourpluginname/lib.php');

$id = required_param('id', PARAM_INT);  // Course Module ID.

if (!$cm = get_coursemodule_from_id('yourpluginname', $id)) {
    print_error('invalidcoursemodule');
}

if (!$course = $DB->get_record('course', array('id' => $cm->course))) {
    print_error('coursemisconf');
}

require_login($course, true, $cm);

$PAGE->set_url('/mod/yourpluginname/index.php', array('id' => $id));
$PAGE->set_title(get_string('modulename', 'yourpluginname'));
$PAGE->set_heading($course->fullname);

echo $OUTPUT->header();
echo $OUTPUT->heading(get_string('modulename', 'yourpluginname'));

// Display a list of instances.
echo $OUTPUT->footer();
```

**Considerations**

- **Parameters**: Use `required_param` and `optional_param` functions to handle input parameters safely.
- **Error Handling**: Use Moodle's `print_error` function to handle errors gracefully.
- **Permissions**: Ensure proper permission checks with `require_login` and other related functions.

### `view.php`

The `view.php` file displays the main content of your plugin. This is where the core functionality and data presentation occur.

**Example Content**

```php
<?php
require('../../config.php');
require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/mod/yourpluginname/lib.php');

$id = required_param('id', PARAM_INT);  // Course Module ID.

if (!$cm = get_coursemodule_from_id('yourpluginname', $id)) {
    print_error('invalidcoursemodule');
}

if (!$course = $DB->get_record('course', array('id' => $cm->course))) {
    print_error('coursemisconf');
}

require_login($course, true, $cm);

$PAGE->set_url('/mod/yourpluginname/view.php', array('id' => $id));
$PAGE->set_title(format_string($cm->name));
$PAGE->set_heading($course->fullname);

echo $OUTPUT->header();
echo $OUTPUT->heading(format_string($cm->name));

// Fetch and display the content of the module instance.
$yourpluginname = $DB->get_record('yourpluginname', array('id' => $cm->instance));
echo format_text($yourpluginname->intro, $yourpluginname->introformat);

echo $OUTPUT->footer();
```

**Considerations**

- **Fetching Data**: Use Moodle's `get_record` or similar functions to fetch data from the database.
- **Display**: Use Moodle's output functions (`$OUTPUT`) to render HTML safely and consistently.
- **Security**: Ensure user permissions are checked before displaying content.
