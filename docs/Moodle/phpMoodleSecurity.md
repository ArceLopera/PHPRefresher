### Key security vulnerabilities

Given below are some of the typical vulnerability types developers need to be aware of when developing web applications, including Moodle.

+ Unauthenticated access
+ Unauthorised access
+ Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
+ Cross-site scripting (XSS)
+ SQL injection
+ Command-line injection
+ Data-loss
+ Confidential information leakage
+ Configuration information leakage
+ Session fixation
+ Denial of service (DOS)
+ Brute-forcing login
+ Insecure configuration management
+ Buffer overruns and other platform weaknesses
+ Social engineering


Data-loss and Confidential information leakage are symptoms of other vulnerabilities.
Some vulnerabilities, such as Configuration information leakage, Command-line injection and Denial of service (DOS) would generally only concern developers of certain types of plugins.

Be sure to read the [Security page](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/security) in the Moodle Developer Resources for more details on each of these and other vulnerabilities.

### Summary of the guidelines

#### Authenticate the user
With very few exceptions, every script should call require_login or require_course_login as near 
the start as possible.


#### Verify course and module access

+ All course areas have to be protected by require_login or require_course_login with correct 
$course parameter.
+ All module areas have to be protected by require_login or require_course_login with correct 
$course and $cm parameter

Example: Consider the index.php file of the Book module.

```php
require(__DIR__.'/../../config.php');
require_once(__DIR__.'/locallib.php');

$id = required_param('id', PARAM_INT); // Course ID.

$course = $DB->get_record('course', ['id' => $id], '*', MUST_EXIST);

unset($id);

require_course_login($course, true);
```

+ require_course_login() is called as soon as $course is found.
+ require_course_login() checks if user can view the course.
+ This page is listing all book modules in a course, so checking for a specific $cm value is not needed here.


Example: Consider the edit.php file of the Book module.

```php
require(__DIR__.'/../../config.php');
require_once(__DIR__.'/locallib.php');
require_once(__DIR__.'/edit_form.php');

$cmid       = required_param('cmid', PARAM_INT);  // Book Course Module ID.
$chapterid  = optional_param('id', 0, PARAM_INT); // Chapter ID.
$pagenum    = optional_param('pagenum', 0, PARAM_INT);
$subchapter = optional_param('subchapter', 0, PARAM_BOOL);

$cm = get_coursemodule_from_id('book', $cmid, 0, false, MUST_EXIST);
$course = $DB->get_record('course', ['id' => $cm->course], '*', MUST_EXIST);
$book = $DB->get_record('book', ['id' => $cm->instance], '*', MUST_EXIST);

require_login($course, false, $cm);
```

+ require_login() is called as soon as the $course and $cm values are found.
+ This page is editing a book so both $course and $cm parameters should be passed to require_login() to check proper access.
+ $autologinguest parameter is false because guest users should not be making changes on the site.


#### Check permissions

+ Before allowing the user to see anything or do anything, call to has_capability or require_capability.
+ Capabilities should be annotated with the appropriate risks.
+ If appropriate, restrict what people can see according to groups.

#### Don't trust any input from users

+ Use moodleforms whenever possible, with an appropriate setType method call for each field.
+ Before performing actions, use data_submitted() && confirm_sesskey() to check sesskey and that you are handling a POST request.
+ Before destroying large amounts of data, add a confirmation step.
+ If not using a moodleform, clean input using optional_param or required_param with an appropriate PARAM_... type. 
**Do not access $_GET, $_POST or $_REQUEST directly.** Group optional_param and required_param calls together at the top of the script, to make them easy to find.

Similarly, clean data from other external resources like RSS feeds before use.

#### Clean and escape data before output

+ Use s or p to output plain text content.
+ Use format_string to output content with minimal HTML like multi-lang spans (for example, course and activity names).
+ Use format_text to output all other content.
    + Only use $options->noclean if it requires a capability with RISK_XSS to input that content (for example web page resources).
+ Data destined for JavaScript should be escaped using $PAGE->requires->data_for_js (Moodle 2.0 onwards) or addslashes_js (Moodle 1.9).

Follow the Output functions to get a better understanding of how dynamic data should be sent from Moodle to the browser.

#### Escape data before storing it in the database

+ Use the XMLDB library. This takes care of most escaping issues for you.
+ The addslashes method should no longer be use anywhere in Moodle 2.0 onwards.
+ Variables must be passed to database queries through bound parameters.

##### Handling database queries
+ Do not attempt to write your own code to directly access the database.
    + It can be prone to SQL injection.
+ Use higher level methods from the [data manipulation API](../Moodle/API/phpMoodleDM.md), like get_record(), whenever possible.
+ Clean all user input by passing appropriate PARAM_XXX to required_param() or optional_param().
+ Escape all input parameters.
+ When you have to insert values into SQL statements, use place-holders to insert the values safely.
    + Before Moodle 2.0, you had to build SQL by concatenating strings. Take particular care, especially with quoting values, 
    to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.
+ Although many DML methods have parameters passed in which are bound/sanitised automatically, some parts will not be:
    + Eg: passed in WHERE or sorting parameters;
    + Raw SQL such as the execute() method.
+ Any code that uses user input to determine the ORDER BY statement should use one of the "safe order by" helper methods:
    + get_safe_orderby() or; 
    + get_safe_orderby_multiple().

##### Database query examples
##### Example 1: String concatenation
###### DO NOT do this

Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries, where possible.
When you have to insert values into SQL statements, use place-holders to insert the values safely.

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM {user} "
  . "WHERE firstname = '" . $fname . "' "
  . "AND lastname = '" . $lname ."'";

$result = $DB->get_record_sql($sql);
```

###### DO this

Use bound parameters to insert values into SQL statements.

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM {user} "
  . "WHERE firstname = ? "
  . "AND lastname = ?";

$result = $DB->get_record_sql($sql, [$fname, $lname]);
```

##### Example 2: WHERE conditions
###### DO NOT do this

Do not use variables directly in the WHERE clause.

```php
$DB->delete_records_select('message', "id = $id");
```


###### DO this

+ Use placeholders (named or question mark) to insert values into WHERE conditions.

```php
$DB->delete_records_select('message', "id = :id", ['id' => $id]);
```

##### Example 3: ORDER BY statement
###### DO NOT do this

Avoid using user supplied values directly to build the ORDER BY statement.

```php
$sort = optional_param('sort', 'username', PARAM_ALPHAEXT);
$dir = optional_param('dir', 'ASC', PARAM_ALPHA);

$result = $DB->get_records('user', null, "$sort $dir");
```

###### DO this

+ Use get_safe_orderby() or get_safe_orderby_multiple() helper functions to construct the ORDER BY statement.

```php
$sort = optional_param('sort', 'username', PARAM_ALPHAEXT);
$dir = optional_param('dir', 'ASC', PARAM_ALPHA);

$sortorder = get_safe_orderby([
        'username' => 'username',
        'firstname' => 'firstname',
        'lastname' => 'lastname',
        'default' => 'username',
    ], $sort, $dir);

$result = $DB->get_records('user', null, $sortorder);
```

#### Escape data before using it in shell commands

+ Avoid shell commands if at all possible.
    + Look to see if there is a PHP library instead.
+ If you can't avoid shell commands, use escapeshellcmd and escapeshellarg.

#### Log every request
Every script should log an event. In case of an issue, logs help to trace the sequence of events that happened.

#### Other good practice
... that helps with security:

+ Structure your code nicely, minimising the use of global variables. This makes the flow of data, and hence security, easier to verify.
+ Initialise objects (for instance, $x = new stdClass;) and arrays ($x = array()) before you first use them.
+ Test every input field with tricky input and exception cases to ensure that it is escaped and un-escaped the right number of times everywhere, and that Unicode characters are not corrupted. One standard test you can use is:

```php
< > & &lt; &gt; &amp; ' \' Á¢Å \ \\
```
