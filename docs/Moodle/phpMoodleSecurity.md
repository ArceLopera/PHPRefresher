#### Key security vulnerabilities

Given below are some of the typical vulnerability types developers need to be aware of when developing web applications, including Moodle.

+ Unauthenticated access
+ Unauthorised access
+ Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
+ Cross-site scripting (XSS)
+ SQL injection
+ Command-line injection
+ Data-loss
+ Confidential information leakage
+ Configuration information leakage
+ Session fixation
+ Denial of service (DOS)
+ Brute-forcing login
+ Insecure configuration management
+ Buffer overruns and other platform weaknesses
+ Social engineering


Data-loss and Confidential information leakage are symptoms of other vulnerabilities.
Some vulnerabilities, such as Configuration information leakage, Command-line injection and Denial of service (DOS) would generally only concern developers of certain types of plugins.

Be sure to read the [Security page](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/security) in the Moodle Developer Resources for more details on each of these and other vulnerabilities.
