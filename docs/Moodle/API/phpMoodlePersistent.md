The Persistent API in Moodle is a framework that simplifies the handling of data records, particularly when dealing with the database. It provides a structured way to interact with database tables, making it easier to create, update, retrieve, and delete records while ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### Key Features of the Persistent API

1. **Encapsulation of Data Logic**: The API encapsulates the logic related to data operations, meaning you work with objects representing your data rather than writing SQL queries directly.
  
2. **Automatic Data Validation**: The Persistent API automatically validates data before it is inserted or updated in the database, ensuring that only valid data is stored.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: By using a consistent interface for data manipulation, the Persistent API makes your code more maintainable and less prone to errors.

4. **Supports Transactions**: The API supports database transactions, allowing multiple operations to be performed atomically.

### Creating a Persistent Class

To use the Persistent API, you define a class that extends `core\persistent`. This class represents a table in the database and encapsulates all the operations that can be performed on that table.

##### Example Structure of a Persistent Class

```php
namespace local_yourplugin;

use core\persistent;

class example extends persistent {
    
    // Define the table name associated with this persistent class
    const TABLE = 'local_yourplugin_example';

    // Define the properties (fields) of the persistent class
    protected static function define_properties() {
        return [
            'name' => [
                'type' => PARAM_TEXT,
                'default' => '',
            ],
            'description' => [
                'type' => PARAM_TEXT,
                'default' => '',
            ],
            'timecreated' => [
                'type' => PARAM_INT,
                'default' => 0,
            ],
            'timemodified' => [
                'type' => PARAM_INT,
                'default' => 0,
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

### Key Components

1. **Table Definition**: 
    The `const TABLE` constant defines the name of the database table that this persistent class represents. While the persistent class is helpful for database interactions, it does not automatically fetch the properties from the database, nor does it create the tables. You will need to create the table yourself, as well as pointing the persistent to it. This can be done by defining the class constant TABLE.

    ```php
    /** Table name for the persistent. */
    const TABLE = 'status';
    ```
    The table name must not contain the Moodle prefix. Also it is common practice to always refer to your table name using the constant.

2. **Property Definitions**: 
    The `define_properties()` method returns an array of fields that map to the columns in the database table. Each field is described by its type (e.g., `PARAM_TEXT`, `PARAM_INT`), default value, and other properties attributes.
    
3. **Properties attributes**:
    - **type**
        The only mandatory attribute. It must be one of the many PARAM_* constants.
    - **default**
        The default value to attach to the property when it hasn't been provided. Without a default, the property's value is required. Alternatively this can be a Closure returning the default value.
    - **null**
        Either of the constants NULL_ALLOWED or NULL_NOT_ALLOWED determining if the null value is accepted. This defaults to NULL_NOT_ALLOWED.
    - **message**
        The default error message (as a lang_string instance) to return when the validation of this field fails.
    - **choices**
        An array of values which the property must fall in.


    ```php

    'messageformat' => [
        'type' => PARAM_INT,
        'default' => FORMAT_PLAIN,
        'choices' => [FORMAT_PLAIN, FORMAT_HTML, FORMAT_MOODLE, FORMAT_MARKDOWN]
    ],
    'location' => [
        'type' => PARAM_ALPHANUMEXT,
        'null' => NULL_ALLOWED,
        'message' => new lang_string('invaliddata', 'error'),
        'default' => function() {
            return get_config('core', 'default_location');
        },
    ]
    ```

    Note that you should always use a Closure for the default value when you cannot guarantee that it will not change since the start of the request. The list of properties and their attributes is cached, and so failure to use a Closure can result in using an outdated default value.

4. **Mandatory properties**:

    Four fields are always added to your persistent and should be reflected in your database table. You must not define those properties in define_properties():

    - **id (non-null integer)**:
        The primary key of the record.
    - **usermodified (non-null integer)**:
        The user who created/modified the object. It is automatically set.
    - **timecreated (non-null integer)**:
        The timestamp at which the record was modified. It is automatically set.
    - **timemodified (non-null integer)**:
        The timestamp at which the record was modified. It is automatically set, and defaults to 0.


    From Moodle 3.7 onwards, the XMLDB tool has an option to add these fields to your table.



### Basic Operations with Persistent API

Once your persistent class is defined, you can easily perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### Creating a Record

To create a new record in the database:

```php
$record = new example(0, (object)[
    'name' => 'Example Name',
    'description' => 'Example description.',
]);

$record->create();
```

#### Retrieving a Record

To retrieve a record by its ID:

```php
$record = new example($id);
echo $record->get('name');
```

#### Updating a Record

To update an existing record:

```php
$record = new example($id);
$record->set('name', 'Updated Name');
$record->update();
```

#### Deleting a Record

To delete a record:

```php
$record = new example($id);
$record->delete();
```

### Advanced Features

#### Transactions

If you need to perform multiple database operations that should be treated as a single transaction:

```php
$transaction = $DB->start_delegated_transaction();

try {
    $record1 = new example(0, $data1);
    $record1->create();

    $record2 = new example(0, $data2);
    $record2->create();

    $transaction->allow_commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    $transaction->rollback($e);
    throw $e;
}
```

#### Validating Data

The Persistent API automatically validates data based on the property definitions. However, you can add custom validation logic by overriding the `validate()` method:

```php
protected function validate() {
    $errors = parent::validate();

    if ($this->get('name') === '') {
        $errors['name'] = 'Name cannot be empty';
    }

    return $errors;
}
```

#### Extending Persistent Classes

You can extend the persistent classes to add more complex functionality specific to your plugin:

```php
class advanced_example extends example {
    public function custom_function() {
        // Custom logic here
    }
}
```

The Moodle Persistent API simplifies the process of interacting with the database by encapsulating data logic within structured classes. It supports automatic data validation, transactions, and CRUD operations, making it easier to maintain and extend your Moodle plugins. By using the Persistent API, you ensure that your code adheres to Moodleâ€™s best practices for data management, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code.

### Integrating Persistent API with Forms

The `core\form\persistent` class in Moodle provides a streamlined way to integrate Moodle forms with the Persistent API. It allows developers to create forms that directly interact with persistent classes, simplifying the process of handling form data, validation, and database operations.

### Key Features

1. **Form Integration with Persistent Classes:**
   - The `core\form\persistent` class connects Moodle forms with persistent classes, ensuring that form submissions are directly mapped to the corresponding database records.

2. **Automatic Data Handling:**
   - Data entered in the form is automatically populated into the persistent class, reducing the need for manual data handling.

3. **Validation Consistency:**
   - Form validation is tightly coupled with the validation logic defined in the persistent class, ensuring consistency across your application.

4. **Simplified CRUD Operations:**
   - CRUD operations are simplified, as the form directly interacts with the persistent class, handling the creation, updating, or deletion of records.

### Steps to Use `core\form\persistent`

1. **Create a Persistent Class:**

   First, define a persistent class representing the database table you want to interact with.

   ```php
   namespace local_yourplugin;

   use core\persistent;

   defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();

   class example extends persistent {
       const TABLE = 'local_yourplugin_example';

       protected static function define_properties() {
           return [
               'name' => [
                   'type' => PARAM_TEXT,
                   'default' => '',
               ],
               'description' => [
                   'type' => PARAM_TEXT,
                   'default' => '',
               ],
           ];
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Form Class Extending `core\form\persistent`:**

   Next, create a form class that extends `core\form\persistent`. This class will handle the form display, validation, and data processing.

   ```php
   namespace local_yourplugin\form;

   use core\form\persistent;

   defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();

   class example_form extends persistent {

       protected static $persistentclass = 'local_yourplugin\example';

       protected function definition() {
           $mform = $this->_form;

           $mform->addElement('text', 'name', get_string('name', 'local_yourplugin'));
           $mform->setType('name', PARAM_TEXT);
           $mform->addRule('name', get_string('required'), 'required', null, 'client');

           $mform->addElement('textarea', 'description', get_string('description', 'local_yourplugin'));
           $mform->setType('description', PARAM_TEXT);

           $this->add_action_buttons();
       }
   }
   ```

   - **`$persistentclass`:** This specifies the persistent class that the form is linked to.
   - **`definition()`:** This method defines the form fields, linking them directly to the properties of the persistent class.

3. **Using the Form in Your Plugin:**

   To use the form in your plugin, create an instance of the form and process it like this:

   ```php
   $form = new \local_yourplugin\form\example_form();

   if ($form->is_cancelled()) {
       // Handle form cancellation (e.g., redirect to another page).
   } else if ($data = $form->get_data()) {
       // The data is automatically saved to the persistent class.
       $form->save_data();
       redirect(new moodle_url('/local/yourplugin/view.php'));
   }

   echo $OUTPUT->header();
   $form->display();
   echo $OUTPUT->footer();
   ```

   - **`is_cancelled()`:** Checks if the form was canceled by the user.
   - **`get_data()`:** Retrieves the form data.
   - **`save_data()`:** Automatically saves the form data to the persistent class, creating or updating the record as necessary.

The `core\form\persistent` class in Moodle offers a powerful and efficient way to connect forms with the Persistent API. It automates the process of handling form data, ensuring that it is correctly validated and saved to the database. This approach reduces boilerplate code, improves consistency, and simplifies the development of complex forms that interact with Moodleâ€™s database.
