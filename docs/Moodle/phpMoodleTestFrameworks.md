Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) are three distinct yet interconnected approaches that help developers create robust and reliable software.

TDD is primarily focused on unit testing and code functionality, BDD centers on system behavior and stakeholder collaboration, and ATDD aligns development with user requirements through acceptance criteria.

Understanding these distinctions can help teams leverage the strengths of each methodology, fostering a more efficient and effective development process.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development is a testing methodology or a programming practice implemented from a developer’s perspective. In this technique, a QA engineer starts designing and writing test cases for every small functionality of an application. This technique attempts to answer a simple question – Is the code valid?

The main intention of this technique is to modify or write a fresh code only when the test fails. Hence it results in lesser duplication of test scripts. This technique is prevalent mainly in agile development ecosystems. In a TDD approach, automated test scripts are written before functional pieces of code. The TDD methodology involves the following steps:

A developer writes an automated test case based on the requirements specified in the documents.
These tests are executed, and in some cases, they fail as they are developed before the development of an actual feature.
The development team then re-factors the code for the test to pass successfully.
TDD can be done by a single developer while writing both tests and application code side by side to complete a feature.
Refactoring refers to modifying the code without changing its main functionality or behavior.

#### Benefits of TDD

+ Reduces the amount of time required for rework
+ Explores bugs or errors very quickly
+ Faster feedback
+ Encourages the development of cleaner and better designs
+ Enhances the productivity of the programmer
+ Allows any team member to start working on the code without a specific team member. This encourages knowledge-sharing and collaboration.
+ It gives the programmer confidence to change an application’s large architecture quickly.
+ Results in the creation of extensive code that is flexible and easy to maintain

#### How to perform TDD

Incorporating Test-Driven Development (TDD) into your software development process can significantly enhance code quality and reduce the likelihood of defects. By following the iterative cycle of writing a test, developing the code, and refactoring, teams can ensure that their software meets its requirements and is adaptable to future changes.

The structured approach outlined above helps to clarify the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, facilitating collaboration and efficiency throughout the development lifecycle.

|Step|	Description|	Stakeholders Involved|
|---|---|---|
|1. Write a Test|	Create a test for a small piece of functionality. This test should initially fail as the code does not yet exist.	|Developers|
|2. Run the Test	|Execute the test suite to ensure the new test fails, confirming that the functionality is not implemented yet.	|Developers|
|3. Implement Code|	Write the minimal amount of code required to pass the test. Focus on just enough implementation to satisfy the test condition.|	Developers|
|4. Run Tests Again|	Run all tests again, including the new test, to check if the new code passes and does not break existing functionality.	|Developers|
|5. Refactor Code	|Optimize the newly implemented code while keeping the functionality intact. This may involve cleaning up code, improving structure, or enhancing performance.	|Developers|
|6. Repeat	|Continue this cycle for each new feature or piece of functionality, gradually building the application with a solid test suite.	|Developers, Project Managers|

### TDD Example

Step 1: Write a Test

Define a test case for the functionality you want to implement such as, the addition of two numbers – “Adding 1 and 2, the result should be 3.”

Step 2: Run the Test

Execute the test. Since the addition function hasn’t been implemented yet, this test will fail, confirming that the functionality is currently absent.

Step 3: Implement Code

After the test fails, the next step is to write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass. It involves creating a function that performs the addition of the two numbers specified in the test.

Step 4: Run Tests Again

Run the test suite again, including the newly added test for the addition function. At this point, the addition test should pass, indicating that the implementation works as intended.

Step 5: Refactor Code

Once the test passes, the next step is to review the code for any potential improvements. This could involve simplifying logic, improving naming conventions, or optimizing performance while ensuring that the functionality remains intact.

Step 6: Repeat

Finally, the process is repeated for additional functionalities. For each new feature, you would write a test, run it to see it fail, implement the code, run the tests again to ensure it passes, and then refactor as necessary.
