Moodle makes use of the Mustache template system to render most of its HTML output, and in some other cases too.

Templates are defined as plain text, which typically includes HTML, and a range of Mustache tags and placeholders. The Mustache placeholders are replaced with actual values during the render of the page. Mustache templates can be rendered both server-side in PHP, and client-side using JavaScript. Themes can overrides the templates defined in other components if required.
